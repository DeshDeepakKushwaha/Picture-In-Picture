Many users want to continue consuming media while they interact with other content, sites, or applications on their device. A common UI affordance for this type of activity is Picture-in-Picture (PIP), where the video is contained in a separate miniature window that is viewable above all other activities. Most desktop and mobile OSs have announced or released platform-level support for PIP, as have many browsers. The proposed Picture-in-Picture API allows websites to initiate and control this behavior.
